## CT-406
### HW5-Dependency-Injection

The eigth homework for CT-406

This assignment consisted of creating web API in ASP.NET Core.  One file is a simple to-do list using web API for its implementation.
The second is using a RESTful API to create a contact manager. An API being RESTful simpily means that it is using the REST architecture
style. This simply means that there are specific constraints being used for the creation of web services. These constraints are:

1. Client-server architecture
2. Statelessness
3. Cacheability
4. Layered system
5. Uniformed interface
